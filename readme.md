# Dotfiles
This repo contains my archlinux dotfiles <br>
I use arch btw

## Todo
- [] Delete dir or file only if its normal folder, and not when its symlink
- [] Also check in the current folder if that dir exists in the first place to symlink 
   it otherwise it will result in loss of config file.
